What is a 'dispute'? A 'Dispute' can be defined as a disagreement between a Buyer and a Seller in connection with a transaction on the Website. How does a 'dispute' occur in the Marketplace? Disputes are filed as a result of a disagreement between the Buyer and the Seller. Disputes arise out of an issue that is raised by either party not being completely satisfied with the resolution of their complaint/issue. It is important that before a Buyer/Seller raises a dispute, they should attempt to solve the issue. Please note that whenever a Buyer raises a dispute, the Seller's payment for that order is put on hold immediately until the issue is resolved. How is a 'dispute' created? Whenever there is a disagreement, the Buyer can write to gm@agriplexindia.com, while the Seller can write to gm@agriplexindia.com, in order to raise a dispute.
